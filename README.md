## Introduction

This project contains a Scala implementation of [ShEx](http://shex.io/). 
The library handles RDF using a 
[simple RDF library](https://github.com/weso/srdf), which at this moment has 2 implementations,
one using [Apache Jena](https://jena.apache.org/)
and another one using [RDF4j](http://rdf4j.org/).
This means that it is possible to use this library to validate RDF models from either Jena or RDF4J models,
as well as from external SPARQL endpoints.

## Installation and compilation

The project uses [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) for compilation as well as Java 1.8.

* `sbt test` compiles and runs the tests

## Implementation details

* The engine is based on Monads using the [cats library](http://typelevel.org/cats/)
* The ShEx compact syntax parser
  is implemented using the following [Antlr grammar](https://github.com/shexSpec/grammar/blob/master/ShExDoc.g4) (previous versions used Scala Parser Combinators)
  which is based on this [grammar](https://github.com/shexSpec/shex.js/blob/master/doc/bnf)
* JSON encoding and decoding uses the Json structure [defined here](https://shexspec.github.io/spec/) and is implemented using [Circe](https://github.com/travisbrown/circe)
* It supports ShEx + extends

## Compatibility tests

We also pass the [ShEx test-suite](https://github.com/shexSpec/shexTest).

<!-- In order to run the shex test-suite and generate the EARL report, you can do the following:

```
sbt
...
sbt:shexRoot> project shex
sbt:shex> test
```
-->

## Publishing to OSS-Sonatype

This project uses [the sbt ci release](https://github.com/olafurpg/sbt-ci-release) plugin for publishing to [OSS Sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org/).

##### SNAPSHOT Releases
Open a PR and merge it to watch the CI release a -SNAPSHOT version

##### Full Library Releases
1. Push a tag and watch the CI do a regular release
2. `git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "v0.1.0"`
3. `git push origin v0.1.0`
_Note that the tag version MUST start with v._

## More information

* An online demo based on this library is available at [http://rdfshape.weso.es](http://rdfshape.weso.es).
* Another online demo based on this library customized for Wikidata is available at [http://wikishape.weso.es](http://wikishape.weso.es).
* This project was based on [ShExcala](http://labra.github.io/ShExcala/) which was focused on Shape Expressions only.
